13032932433,447188370,Rhys69420,Faulty charge,I wanted to replay a snap and it asked me to subscribe for 2.50 a month. Upon completing my purchase it updated last second to show that the plan was annual and billed me $30. I did not get a chance to change the plan or cancel my purchase once it switched to $29.99. This was a low move. They know what they’re doing. That was a scummy move on their part. Please don’t buy this stupid app,1,2025-08-18T15:03:24-07:00

13032783930,447188370,BarPrepSucks,Too much,"Snap chat has historically been great for simple usage. It now has constant notifications/new things to distract you with, and it's awful. The content is ridiculous.",1,2025-08-18T14:07:42-07:00
13032662107,447188370,cdghfbv,My opinion on this app,"I do like it! I think it’s a great way to contact friends and but this app does have a huge problem with sexual context getting shared and being asked for nudes. I don’t appreciate that at all so if something could get in-forced to make that not happen so much, that would be lovely.",5,2025-08-18T13:24:01-07:00

13032537489,447188370,Wpedm,Forced content,"Snapchat used to be a simple app — just friends sending pictures and messages back and forth. That’s all it needed to be. But now? It feels like it’s turned into a circus of unwanted, low-quality content shoved in your face at every turn. The “Discover” section is the worst offender. It’s flooded with clickbait headlines, trashy tabloid stories, and cheap, recycled internet nonsense that nobody actually asked for. Half of it looks like it was designed to prey on teenagers’ insecurities or just stir up drama. And let’s be real: who opens Snapchat because they want to scroll through bottom-of-the-barrel internet articles? No one. Yet the app forces it on us.

Then there’s “Spotlight.” It’s basically TikTok’s annoying little brother, full of random, low-effort videos from strangers that have nothing to do with you or your friends. The content quality is abysmal — mostly repetitive trends, people trying way too hard to go viral, or flat-out cringe clips that you’d never waste your time on if you had the choice. But Snapchat doesn’t care. It just keeps pumping it at you, as if it’s doing you some kind of favor.

And now, they’ve crossed another line: ads in our chat boxes. Let that sink in — we can’t even have private conversations with friends without corporations wedging themselves right into the middle of it. It’s invasive, desperate, and honestly insulting. Your chat screen is supposed to be personal, but Snapchat decided that selling your attention is more important than respecting your space.

The whole app feels less like a social platform and more like a giant billboard disguised as a messaging service. What was once about genuine connections has turned into an aggressive content dump where ads, clickbait, and mindless videos take center stage, while the actual reason we downloaded the app — talking to our friends — gets buried.

It’s frustrating, it’s exhausting, and it’s unnecessary. Snapchat has stopped listening to its users and instead turned into yet another platform more interested in shoving garbage in your face than actually providing value. It’s a shame, because it could be a great app. Instead, it feels like you have to wade through a swamp of junk just to use it for its original purpose. And honestly? I’m tired of it.",1,2025-08-18T12:39:53-07:00
