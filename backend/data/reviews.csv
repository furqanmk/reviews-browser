13032932433,447188370,Rhys69420,Faulty charge,I wanted to replay a snap and it asked me to subscribe for 2.50 a month. Upon completing my purchase it updated last second to show that the plan was annual and billed me $30. I did not get a chance to change the plan or cancel my purchase once it switched to $29.99. This was a low move. They know what they’re doing. That was a scummy move on their part. Please don’t buy this stupid app,1,2025-08-18T15:03:24-07:00

13032537489,447188370,Wpedm,Forced content,"Snapchat used to be a simple app — just friends sending pictures and messages back and forth. That’s all it needed to be. But now? It feels like it’s turned into a circus of unwanted, low-quality content shoved in your face at every turn. The “Discover” section is the worst offender. It’s flooded with clickbait headlines, trashy tabloid stories, and cheap, recycled internet nonsense that nobody actually asked for. Half of it looks like it was designed to prey on teenagers’ insecurities or just stir up drama. And let’s be real: who opens Snapchat because they want to scroll through bottom-of-the-barrel internet articles? No one. Yet the app forces it on us.

Then there’s “Spotlight.” It’s basically TikTok’s annoying little brother, full of random, low-effort videos from strangers that have nothing to do with you or your friends. The content quality is abysmal — mostly repetitive trends, people trying way too hard to go viral, or flat-out cringe clips that you’d never waste your time on if you had the choice. But Snapchat doesn’t care. It just keeps pumping it at you, as if it’s doing you some kind of favor.

And now, they’ve crossed another line: ads in our chat boxes. Let that sink in — we can’t even have private conversations with friends without corporations wedging themselves right into the middle of it. It’s invasive, desperate, and honestly insulting. Your chat screen is supposed to be personal, but Snapchat decided that selling your attention is more important than respecting your space.

The whole app feels less like a social platform and more like a giant billboard disguised as a messaging service. What was once about genuine connections has turned into an aggressive content dump where ads, clickbait, and mindless videos take center stage, while the actual reason we downloaded the app — talking to our friends — gets buried.

It’s frustrating, it’s exhausting, and it’s unnecessary. Snapchat has stopped listening to its users and instead turned into yet another platform more interested in shoving garbage in your face than actually providing value. It’s a shame, because it could be a great app. Instead, it feels like you have to wade through a swamp of junk just to use it for its original purpose. And honestly? I’m tired of it.",1,2025-08-18T12:39:53-07:00

I loved this app. 

I even FINALLY got access to the Live feature that I plan to share my artwork/woodworking. 

Unfortunately, after the 2024 election, TikTok apparently decided that our First Amendment rights are no longer valid. What’s not allowed? The word “rigged”? I’m polite, respectful, and thoughtful with my words and intentions—but suddenly the PRESIDENT is a taboo subject—ESPECIALLY if the comments are not in FAVOR of the current fascist administration?

We have supported TikTok—especially since they tried to ban this app—and THIS is how we’re thanked?! By stifling OUR rights?!

I have said NOTHING non factual, albeit not supportive of this administration, yet when people say things that are false, misleading, or plainly abhorrent towards the TikTok community and humanity—it’s NOT removed???

How can we feel comfortable with interacting in the app, if we get strikes for the MOST ridiculous reasons—and others are able to say the most outrageous things? It’s not just me… there’s actually videos discussing this issue. 

Please do better TikTok. We need you behind us now, more than ever.",1,2025-08-24T19:49:31-07:00

13056344115,835599320,Marsha 🚀,love this app but..,"I wanted to share some feedback about the new drafts section layout. Right now, it shows the filter name instead of the audio name. This makes it really difficult to manage my drafts because most of mine use the same filter, so I can’t tell which draft is which unless I open and play the video.

The old version was much easier to use because it showed the audio name at the bottom, which helped me instantly recognize the exact draft I wanted to post. If a video doesn’t have a filter, it still shows the audio name, so I think it would make sense for videos with filters to also display the audio instead. The filter is less important in identifying the draft compared to the audio.

It would be great if the drafts section could go back to the original format where the audio name is always visible. That way, it’s much easier and more practical to organize and choose drafts to post.

Thank you for considering this!",5,2025-08-24T14:44:07-07:00

It’s actually unnecessary on some peoples ends because some 16 year olds don’t have an ID to verify themselves. You should just limit what they say (cuss words and other words) Not take away their chatting privileges. People make real friends just from chatting on TikTok (I did and were 5 years strong) So again, instead of taking away chatting for 16 under, just limit the words they can say. Also if this app is 12+ why not just do 13+ age verification? Taking away their chatting abilities is insane and unnecessary.

For the price of two fancy coffees or one suspiciously large gas station burrito, you can stream every song you’ve ever loved, plus 10 million you’ll skip after 3 seconds.

The algorithm? Oh, it knows me. It knows I want sad breakup songs when I haven’t even been in a relationship since the Obama administration. It knows I want Viking battle chants at 2 a.m. on a Wednesday. It even knows that my guilty pleasure is early 2000s pop punk… and it won’t let me forget it.

Spotify Premium is like being rich in music but broke in real life. Ads disappear, downloads appear, and suddenly you’re the kind of person who thinks, “Yeah, I do need a playlist called ‘Songs for Pretending I’m in a Movie Trailer.

Consequently I am forced to endure the existence of 8, empty looking ‘New Folder’ ‘s. This has become a serious annoyance. I don’t want to delete playlists I’m working on, or copy every one into newly designed folders or just push them back to my playlist library.

I didn't have premium but I could still listen to my favorite songs and songs I didn't even know that I liked until now. But yesterday, I was playing one of my favorite songs from a playlist. Then the song cut off. I didn't really mind and didn't pay attention to it until later i wanted to listen to some music. I pressed on the same song but it was greyed out. I clicked on it again and it said ""you have found a premium feature. Buy premium to play this song."" I was kind of sad but then i realized, all of my songs in every single one of my playlist are greyed out. And it says the same thing. I thought premium is for like no ad listening and stuff. Please fix this Spotify. I really like your app. I hope Spotify sees this. 💔🌿",3,2025-08-24T12:13:22-07:00

13055177891,324684580,ParadoxicallyThinking,Great streaming service with some flaws.,"I love Spotify, I’ve used it for years. It’s most known for being free so long as you’re okay with missing out on some features, and having to deal with ads. It is objectively better than Apple Music mostly because you are given much more freedom and control over your playback, such as; Crossfade, Customizable EQ, full control over volume levels, full control over audio quality on both cellular and wifi connections, and more recently custom mixing where you can specialize specific songs with their own exclusive EQ and details, whether than having every song you listen to be locked to one setting. My biggest issue with this app is how easy it is to accidentally swipe and skip a song. I find myself constantly accidentally switching between songs when trying to swipe down to get the media player out of the way. Despite its few flaw, Spotify has always been a staple brand for anyone looking to simply stream music, as long as you aren’t really nerdy, -like me- and you don’t care about statistics like audio quality, or EQ stuff, this app will be great for you. But even if you do care about the nerdy stuff I’d still recommend it. Mostly because you aren’t going to find another one that gives you as much freedom as Spotify does. So it essentially comes down to what you’re looking for in a streaming platform.",5,2025-08-24T08:14:14-07:00
